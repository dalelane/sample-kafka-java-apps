    "text": "My sister got this for me as a \"just because\" gift. I absolutely love it! The gems on the necklace are really ornate and it's an unusual piece of jewelry. The copper color makes it stand out from the typical silver or gold in other jewelry. Perfect long length & weight - the magnifying glass even works (a little bit). :-)",
