    "text": "As a long-time wearer of Wacoal bras, I was really excited to receive this in the mail. However, I found myself so disappointed in this bra that I sent it back to Amazon. I think I am going to spend the extra $20 to get the other model bra mentioned in other reviews! Here are the problems I had with the bra:<br /><br />Material: It feels much more cheap than my other Wacoal bras. Also, there is a little ring on each bra strap that attaches it to the band, and I don't have much confidence that it will hold together.<br /><br />Band: There are only 2 hook-and-eye closures on the back of the bra (I wear a 32DD). This feels insufficient compared to my other Wacoals.<br /><br />Sizing: The bra, for me, runs larger than expected. Every single one of my Wacoal bras is a 32DD, and the cup size on this model is too big. I have not lost weight as I immediately put on a different Wacoal bra in the same size, and it still fits perfectly.<br /><br />I am a huge proponent of Wacoal bras - just not this particular model.",
