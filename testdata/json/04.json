    "text": "I\u2019ll start by saying I love this robe!  I truly do. Luckily I\u2019d read other reviews and although normally I would immediately wash every item of clothing I purchase I decided to check the sewing and seams first. That said the quality assurance person should be fired. As you can see in the photos 2 seams are already coming undone as they were not seen properly.  There is also what I call \u201cbobbin vomit\u201d in several places where gobs of thread are in and around the seams and in other places there are just loose threads.  Some of the seams do not match up either. If it wasn\u2019t for the seams that are already coming undone it is something I would normally overlook as it was close enough.  The other issue is the size. I\u2019m 5\u2019 10\u201d tall and I ordered the large/extra large as I\u2019d read some complaints about size and especially short sleeve length. Let me tell you these sleeves will hold monkey arms!  I rolled them up twice!  They never happens to me with a large or extra large robe which I always buy big just to get the longer sleeve length. The length of time is excellent too as it is down between my calves and my ankles. I love the color. I love the robe, but due to the sewing errors as is bound to happen in mass manufacturing I am sending it back. I wish they had the sizes separated by small, medium, large, and extra large not lumping them s/m and l/xl.  I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to try the robe in a size smaller or just try a different robe.  If this robe was free of sewing mistakes I would have just kept it for a taller friend of mine.  It is the perfect weight. It\u2019s not too heavy and it\u2019s not too light. It is soft. It is fluffy. The pockets are nice and the sayin trummis a nice touch I love the hood. It was the deciding factor in my choosing this robe in the first place.  I\u2019ll be sad to see it go as it really is an excellent robe if it didn\u2019t have the bad seams in 2 places and the Bobbin vomit thread issues.  It\u2019s the kind of robe you will want to snuggle and cuddle into and with someone. Two people will easily fit in this one!  I\u2019m just afraid that if I buy the s/m that the arms will not be long enough and the robe length will be shorter too. I also hate that most s/m robe belts hit me under my breasts instead of at my natural waist and the pockets are located under each breast instead of along my hips. This robe belt fits perfectly at my waist and the pockets sit perfectly at my hips with no awkward belting or pocket maneuvering involved.  I\u2019m really going to miss this robe!  I suspect I will end up with another one shortly, but hopefully one without flaws.",
