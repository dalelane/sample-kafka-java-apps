    "text": "These are the slippers of boots - totally comfortable the minute you slide your feet inside.<br /><br />Sizing: I normally wear a straight-up size 6.5 in boots, really no matter the brand. I like to wear a normal-thickness pair of tight athletic socks. I almost bought a size 6 after reading some of the reviews about the boots being way too large, but I ended up going with my gut and sticking with a 6.5. I'm so glad I did - they are the perfect fit. Just enough room in the toe box with socks on. I think that if you have narrow feet, the boots might feel too loose for you around the side of the foot. I have a normal width, so they felt comfortable to me. Keep in mind that you can somewhat adjust the tightness of the boot with those side button things. They are a little difficult to work with, but it's doable. If this helps, I wear a 7 in Merrell's hiking shoes, so I somewhat sized down into my usual boot size to purchase these.<br /><br />Arch support: kind of meh, but not terrible either. I'd rate it somewhere in-between. You can always swap out the insoles for your custom orthotics.<br /><br />Style: intended to be somewhat comfy-slouchy, so if you're looking for a more stiffly-conforming boot, I would recommend you try a different style. These have a kind of an urban mod feel to them, which I love!",
