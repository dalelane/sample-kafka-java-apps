    "text": "I absolutely LOVE this hat. I have had a very difficult time finding a hat to fit my small head, even resorting to purchasing kid-sized fedoras. While this isn't a &#34;petite&#34; sized hat, I trusted the other reviewers and ordered it anyway. So glad I did! It fits great and doesn't look too big for my head. The adjustable string inside is perfect and the fabric-lined interior is comfortable - not at all itchy. I saw some people asked if the hat could be crushed. I don't think that is the best idea. Wallaroo makes another kind of hat that is meant to be crushed, but the brim is different that this one.",
