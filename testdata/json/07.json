    "text": "Absolutely gorgeous! I'm 5'1\" and the dress does need to be hemmed by about 3-4 inches. In the pics, there was hem glue on the white lining, so it was easier not to step on it. It got so, so filthy at the fair but easily washed out and no ironing needed! For reference I got the size S/M, and I'm 135 lbs. I was able to cinch the waist in front and in the back.",
