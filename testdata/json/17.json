    "text": "So comfy! I made the mistake of trying these on before trying the Lindsey style on - which ruined it for me because the waistband makes these SO Comfortable! Especially since I'm a curvy girl. I bought both styles and while I do love the extra style, details and pockets on the Lindsey I'm returning those and buying another of these Morgan because for me comfort rules the world. That said these are also very flattering! Well made as well. I'd recommend especially if you have a curvy figure!",
