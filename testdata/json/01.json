    "text": "Unfortunately Amazon in their wisdom (cough, cough) decided to ship the snowsuit in a vinyl bag with holes in it!  There was no other bag to protect the snowsuit inside vinyl bag with all the holes.  This is what happened:  Arrived in hub locker. It was the very top locker. Opened it & pulled the pkg out getting a very wet & nasty surprise at the same time. My senses were assaulted. Smells like tea tree oil. Feels like conditioner or lotion.  I can\u2019t understand how the delivery person a) didn\u2019t smell that mess when they shoved the pkg in b) didn\u2019t see the mess when they shoved it in - tho if they were short I guess that would explain it bc I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d & I didn\u2019t see it until the pkg was in my hands. The locker was up high & dark, but I could smell it the minute I walked into the hub locker room. I happen to be extremely allergic to tea tree oil.  It\u2019s made from mellaleuca trees which grow all over southwest Florida where I was raised.  Tho native to Australia they were used to help drain the swamps of Florida generations ago bc they soak up so much water.  It has a very distinct smell & unfortunately is frequently used as a \u201ccarrier oil\u201d for other oils & body lotions,  shampoos, conditioners, etc., so I have to be hyper-vigilant to avoid exposure.  Instead- Last night I got to suck down Benadryl & pray my throat didn\u2019t close while keeping my epi-pens handy.  The liquid went through the holes & onto the snowsuit as you can clearly see in the pictures.  So I guess the suit is waterproof.  Looks true to size.  Elastic appears stretchy.  I\u2019m super annoyed that this arrived in this condition & could have easily been avoided by amazon properly wrapping it to avoid the elements whatever they may be.",
