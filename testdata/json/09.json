    "text": "Though these look cute on the outside, in reality these were a bad buy and not at all what I expected based on the description. For one thing, I wear a size 6-7. Knowing they run a bit small, per other reviewers, I purchased the medium (size 7-8), and my toes pressed up against the front of the slipper! Also, if you look at the photo, there is a seam at the ankle where the footie joins with the rest of the slipper. This seam was really uncomfortable, digging into my skin when I walked. The buttons, which look as though they have a function, are actually just decorative. And the worst part? That lovely soft tuft of fur you can see poking out the top of the slipper doesn't go all the way down - just to the base of your ankle. The rest of the inside is made of a plain fabric. Overall, a poorly made item that I ultimately returned.",
