Zero interior pockets so nowhere to put glasses, iPhone, etc other than the 2 exterior pockets which should be larger imo as they are the only pockets.  Seems to me like they used a too large needle with the thread in mine bc it\u2019s like the air comes through every single hole the thread is in that they used for decoration/insulation to give it a quilted effect.  With cotton fabrics you wash it & the material will shrink around the thread & you don\u2019t have the air coming through the too large holes made by the needle.  I usually stick with the non-quilted versions of non-cotton coats fit this reason.  It looks nice, but it does not keep me warm in northern Colorado where we dip into negative temps & have crazy high winds.  I was not impressed with it. Got it in tye try before you buy program without realizing I would have to pay for bags to return the items I tried or that I would have to drop them off at ups. I\u2019m disabled.  I don\u2019t drive.  So fun to pay for taxis to return stuff when Amazon has a flipping hub at my apt complex.  Why can\u2019t they make returns simpler?  Delivered to the hub & I should be able to return it to the hub imo.  Really ticks me off I don\u2019t get anything delivered to my door anymore since moving to an apt. As a disabled person it\u2019s a massive pain in my tush.  Every step is agony & the stuff weighs more than I am supposed to lift.  It\u2019s a long walk when you\u2019re in chronic pain.  Should have sent it back with the rest bc now I\u2019ll have to pay for another $3 bag & taxis, but I wanted to try it in colder weather since it matched the color of my boots.  My bad.  Useless in cold weather.  The other issue I noticed was I tried 3 Columbia jackets in the same size (xl) bc I like to wear fleece & layers under my coats due to the temps here & the difference in sizing was ridiculous.  This was a true xl while the other two were not.  Easily managed camisole, T-shirt, & long sleeved, very thick, fleece shirt under it.  Just does not keep you warm on its own.  It\u2019s a spring jacket imo not winter.  It has a fuzzy fur inside & I have coke to prefer fleece lined jackets bc I have service dogs & their fur is easier to get off flat fleece than fluffy fur.",
