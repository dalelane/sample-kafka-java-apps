    "text": "I purchased these bc they are supposed to be waterproof. Mine are not.  Wore them in Colorado in 36 degree weather & I can feel air coming into the toe bed so my toes were cold.  Maybe they didn\u2019t waterproof mine all the way idk or not at all bc mine are not.  I wire regular athletic socks today, but will try them again with wool socks later.  Either way they are one of the most comfy boots I have ever worn. The cushioning is magnificent. I\u2019m disabled & have bad knees, hips, & spine & these were the most comfy shoes I\u2019ve probably had in my life. I say that as an LL Bean, Land\u2019s End, Merrel, Keen, & Columbia long time wearer.  I got the baby blue color for around $40 with tax which is a great deal imo.  The only big issue is I purchased them for winter walks with my dogs so they won\u2019t work for their intended purposes. My dilemma is whether to keep them for spring boots.  The light color means they will get dirty fast so idk.  I just know they are crazy comfy & feel wonderful on my feet. I might try them with some fleece socks too & probably just spray them with boot waterproofing.  They are like a canvas tennis shoe. The material they are made out of.  So super light which I love due to my disabilities, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be wearing these in the back country walks bc of the color I picked. Which I picked solely based on the price. I\u2019m cost effective not cheap lol.  I admit when I got them from the amazon locker they were so incredibly light that I expected garbage.  While these are very light they are also an excellent walking boot imo tho if you need them to be waterproofed good luck bc mine are not.  If you are sticking to plowed roads & sidewalks & avoid big drifts of snow & wear a thick wool sock these will probably work very well if you\u2019re looking for a comfy hiking boot.  Unfortunately I need something that can go off roads into the wilderness & snow drifts bc that\u2019s where my service dogs prefer to walk. Lol.",
