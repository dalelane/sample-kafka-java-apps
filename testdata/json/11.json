All the adult sized hats sized small are still too large in circumference. So here is a pic of me in the hat so you can see what it looks like. I was in an Athleta fashion show, lol. I am really not made for the runway. I tried to do a little pirouette thingy and my shoes with their rubber bottoms kinda got stuck as I spun around and it looked super awkward. Anyway, I digress. The hat. The quality is good for a &#34;made in China&#34; item, the inner brim is not at all itchy. It's not the most ventilatory thing to wear in 190 million percent humidity, but as my mother always said, pain is the price for beauty. I also purchased the hat in another color. You really can't go wrong with this accessory! So buy it now!! :-)",
